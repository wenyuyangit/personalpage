I am a Ph.D student at the Information and Communication Technology and Engineering (ICTE), [Universit√† degli studi di Napoli "Parthenope"](https://www.uniparthenope.it/) since Nov. 2021.

I specialize in the study of Remote sensing, in particular SAR tomography and polarimetry. I do this mostly with the help of deep learning models.

I am also active in the topics of data analysis, software development, and marketing. On this website, you'll find info and links to the projects I contribute to.
